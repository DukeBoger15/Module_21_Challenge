# Module 21 Challenge
<li>This repository contains my FinTech Bootcamp Module 21 Challenge code.</li>
<h1>Background</h1>
<li>After years of waitting and several examinations, I was selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to be part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent FinTech professional, I was chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin, as "Kasei" means "Mars" in Japanese.</li>
<h1>What I am Creating</h1>
<li>I will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.</li>
<li>The crowdsale contract that I will create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing the users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. My contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.</li>
<h2>Packages/Libraries or Technologies Used</h2>
<li>This module challenge requires the use of the following packages/technologies:</li>
<li>Remix - Remix IDE is a no-setup tool with a GUI for developing smart contracts. Remix plays well with other tools, and allows for a simple deployment process to the chain of your choice.</li>
<li>Solidity - Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.</li>
<li>MetaMask - MetaMask is a software currency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension which can be used to interact with decentralized applications.</li>
<li>Ganache - Ganache is a high-end development tool, used for running your personal local blockchain network for developing decentralized applications on Ethereum.</li>
