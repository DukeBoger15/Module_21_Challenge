# Module 21 Challenge
<li>This repository contains my FinTech Bootcamp Module 21 Challenge code.</li>
<h1>Background</h1>
<li>After years of waitting and several examinations, I was selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to be part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent FinTech professional, I was chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin, as "Kasei" means "Mars" in Japanese.</li>
<h1>What I am Creating</h1>
<li>I will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.</li>
<li>The crowdsale contract that I will create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing the users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. My contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.</li>
<h2>Packages/Libraries or Technologies Used</h2>
